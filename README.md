## Hi, I'm Luis! 🐈‍⬛🏳️‍🌈

### About Me

- I'm a 4<sup>th</sup>-year Political Science major who wastes *wayyy* too much time coding&hellip;
- My favorite languages are Rust and Julia, but I'll write in any language as long as the project itself is fun.
- My interests include graph theory, numerical optimization, and scientific computing.
- Outside of open-source software, I enjoy reading, travelling, and pretty much everything cat-related. Meow! 🐈
